First create a Singly Linked List class and create a Node class.
Then definde a count() function using recursion to count the number of nodes
in certain SLL.This function takes head of SLL as the input.The base case is
when tail.pointer is None,then return 0,and every time head.pointer is
implemented the number will increment by 1.
Then create a SLL.Put all the elements in a list in the head of SLL,then use
insert_head,insert__tail,delete_head meathod to modify the SLL.
At last,define a main() function.First,use while True,try-except to examine
the wrong input and promt user to enter again.Let n equal to the reference
to head of SLL,which is lis.head,if user's input is right,print the number
of nodes in SLL,then break the loop,if user's input is wrong,prompt user to
enter again.The last while loop is to print the element of all nodes in SLL
in turn.
