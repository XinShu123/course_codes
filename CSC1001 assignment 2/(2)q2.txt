first,we need a reverse(number) function.Use reminder and mode to get the digit and and
use a list to store the digits, then use an empty string for digits to fill in.
At last,return the integer form of the string.
Then,we can use reverse(number) to define isNotPalindrome(number)
to check whether a number isn't a palindrome.Just when a number is not
equals to the reverse of it can we say that the number is not a palindrome.
Third,we need to define isPrime(number) function to check whether a number is a prime
number or not.so first set the divisor equals to 2,then if the number can be
divided by 2,we can say that it's not a prime.if the number cannot be divided
by 2, then we add the divisor by 1,then repeat the process as before.Until
the divisor is larger than the squre root of the number can we finish
the check process,which means that a number can not be divided by any number
which is no larger than the square root of it.Then it can jump out of the while
loop and we can say that it is a prime number(so we return True).
Fourth, we need to define the reversalIsPrime(number) function to check
whether the reverse of a number is a prime or not.we can just use reverse(number)
 and isPrime(number) to define.
Finally,we need to define a main() function to integrate all the pre-defined
functions and print the first 100 emirp numbers.to print the first 100 emirp
numbers,we need the count variable to count the number of prime numbers and
an n variable to represent the prime numbers.we
initialize the count = 0,and use a while loop,let count<=99 as the checking
condition.
we know that the smallest prime
number is 2,so we first set n = 2,then checkt the condition for being a emirp
number using pre-defined functions.if it is ,we need to print the number and
then the number needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the next-time loop,
and also the count needs to be incremented by 1.during this, if the count can
be divided by 10,we need to change the line for the purpose of putting
10 numbers each line.if the number isn't an emirp number,we just need to add the
number by 1 and coutinue to check.
