so I first define a function isAnagram(s1,s2) to check whether two strings
are anagram or not.I create one list for each string and use for loop to
divide the string and append the character into lists.Then I sort the lists
and if the sorted lists are the same,we can say that two words are anagram.
Otherwise,it isn't.
Then I define the main() to prompt the user to enter two words and use isAnagram(s1,s2)
as the conditional statement to return is an anagram or not.
