first,I want to clarify that I am using arr[row] = column to represent the
number list I will generate to display the picture.so first I define a
verify(arr,checkRow) for verifying whether a certain column in checkRow
is in conflict with previous Queens' positions.Because I check it by row,so
there is no possibility that two queens are in the same row,so I only need to
check if they are in the same column and same right and left diagonal.for one
checkRow,I just need to check the previous row with it one by one,so I use three
for loops to iterate through the previous row and check the three conditions.
if any of condition is satisfied,return False. and if a certain column in
checkRow do not satisfy three conditions,which means it can jump out of the three
for loops and we can say that this certain column in checkRow is valid and return
True.
Then I define a solve() to generate the result using verify(arr,checkRow).To
match the index of the arr with the row number, I add a 0 into the start of
the arr. I initialize rowOne = rowTwo = rowThree = rowFour = rowFive = rowSix
= rowSeven = rowEight = 1,which means that they start from the first column to
check.Then I use eight for loops for each row to check each column.in each for
loop,I use range(1,9),which represents 8 columns, and use verify(arr,checkRow)
to check if the column is valid or not,if it is invalid,the loop stop this column's
loop and continue to check next column in the same row,if it is valid,it will
jump into the next row's for loop and continue the process before.At eighth
loop,if it is valid, we can finally stop the loop and return the result number
list.
Then I define display() to convert the numberlist returned by solve() to the picture.
Set a variable rowLis represent the list returned by solve().Then for eight rows,
each row has eight columns,for each column in each row,if it equals to rowLis[row],
print('|Q| ',end = ''),if it doesn't equal to, then print('| ',end = ''), and
for each row we need to change a line,so print().
And finally, call the display function and the result is printed.
