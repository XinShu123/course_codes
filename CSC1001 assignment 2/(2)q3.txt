first,I define the getdigit(number) to get the sum of digits is a number is
larger than or equal to 10.so we can just use divmod() to get the digits.
if the number is larger than or equal to 10,then we will add its digits and
return the result.if it isn't,we just return the number.
second, I define the sumOfDoubleEvenPlace(number) to calculate the sumup of
the even place numbers.I transfer the number into a string, and create a variable
index to control the while loop(and initilize it be len(number)-2 because it
is the index of the last even place digit.) and initialize sumup be 0. and use
a while loop to iterate through the whole number and check if the double
digit is larger than 10.if it is, use sumOfDoubleEvenPlace(number) to calculate
the result,else,just double itself and all results of two cases will be added
to the sumup. and At last,return sumup.
Third,I need to define the sumOfOddPlace(number),similar to sumOfDoubleEvenPlace(number)
,I transfer the number into a string, and create a variable index to control the while loop(and initilize it be len(number)-1 because it
is the index of the last odd place digit.) and initialize sumup be 0.and just
add all the odd place digits altogether.
and Finally,I need to define isValid(),in which I prompts the user to enter
their credit card number as an integer and then transfer it into a string and
check if it is starting with 4 or 5 or 6 or 37 and their number of digits is
between 13 and 16,if it satisfies, then I transfer it into an integer and check
if sumOfDoubleEvenPlace(number)+sumOfOddPlace(number)) % 10 == 0,if it satisfies,
then we can say it is valid,otherwise(if any of the previously listing condition
is not satisfied),return invalid.
