There are some possible errors:Users may input strings as lower and upper limit;
the lower limit may be larger than upper limit;the number of subintervals must
be an integer rather than a float number; the number of subintervals must be
no smaller than 1.So in my program I tried to identify and correct these inputting
errors.

As for excecution,I first import function from math,then
convert user input into function name,in the end use while loop to iterately sum up
the integration.
